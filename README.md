# self-calibration-of-sensor-location
detect the sensor location based on its signal and complementary vision data
1.compute.m compute the heat map of all the sensors, and the max heat map among them.
2.findbeam.m find the location of beams, which accords to each sensor.
3.findlocation.m using the similarity to match the most likely sensor location.
4.main.m, run all the function above and revise the result.
